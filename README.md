# Portfolio-Project

Hi All, this is my portfolio project. The goal of this was to implement my HTML/CSS and Bootstrap skills into a functional portfolio webpage.

I intend to recreate this in the future with jquery and my javascripting abilities. But for now, I'll leave it as is. I originally coded this in codepen via the Free Code Camp curriculum.
